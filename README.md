# UI-STORE

Built with React.js. Created my own components and added **uuid** for list item keys.

Live version ---> [HERE](https://lemonstener.github.io/fasc-ui)

This is the **refurbish** branch, the place where I push fixes in order to improve the overall product. Noticebale changes:
- changed the way things are displayed on smaller screens to be more aesthetically pleasing, added additional media queries
- modals now actually behave like modals
- added tests using **react-testing-library** for **App**,**Product**, and **Modal**

## How to run

- **npm install**
- **npm start**
